## Content

Welcome to our official technology blog. The idea is to share with the Community about our technology challenges. A blog post in an engineering blog should show readers what in-house engineering teams are actually working on. Engineering posts help peers understand what a particular individual or team within a much larger organization actually works on, keeping sales and marketing to an absolute minimum. These posts tell us about an engineering teamâ€™s philosophy as well as their stack.

They should be educational. Well-written blog posts offer unique perspectives and different solutions to old problems. They help the reader learn about a specific topic and technology, and walk readers through how that topic/technology is applied to help the team work through a challenge. Readers should learn something new. 

Regardless of the topic, the first question to ask yourself is, "Why should a reader care?" Readers don't just want to look at a blog post and say, "Cool, Company X did this thing...." and that's it. At the very least, they want to understand:

- Why was this approach taken?  
- What went into deciding on that approach?  
- What is this [topic/software/etc] that was chosen and why?  
- What lessons came out of it? 
 
Engineering blog posts are not just about "show and tell"; they're how our engineering teams shares knowledge with peers across the wider tech community. And engineering blog posts provide value to the engineers writing them; they increase an engineer's profile and they give the engineer the chance to share what they've worked on. Also, they're a great way of attracting new candidates ;-)

Do you have an interesting topic to share but it's not technical? we have a place for that too, please check: https://medium.com/backbase


## Publishing an article

* Branch out of `main` branch.
* Ensure you're part of the list of authors in [_data/authors.yml](_data/authors.yml). Add your profile image to folder [assets/images/avatars/](assets/images/avatars/).
* Create a file inside folder [_posts/](_posts/) with the following naming convention: `yyyy-mm-dd-title-with-spaces.md`
* Add images that you'll use in this post to folder [assets/images/post/](assets/images/post/)
* Ensure your header is correct. Use existing posts as an example, both for the header and the content.
* Ensure you [run it locally](#build-locally) and double check everything is fine in your browser before submitting a PR to branch `main`.

## Linting your posts

We use Google Style Guide and write-good to provide consistent writing style.

The linting tool is [Vale](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale) and you can run it locally by following the [installation](https://docs.errata.ai/vale/install) and running the following command.


```bash
$ vale --glob='*.md' --minAlertLevel=warning .
```
