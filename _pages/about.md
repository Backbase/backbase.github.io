Backbase is a global fintech company creating the best digital banking solutions on the planet. We are a young-spirited, diverse (45+ nationalities), fast-growing and leading company in our niche.

It all started in 2003 in Amsterdam, with just two people, our founder Jouk Pleiter and a partner, who had a shared vision to ‘make the internet more beautiful’. Fast-forward 16 years later, and we are the backbone of over 100 banks all around the world and part of the day-to-day banking experience of over 50 million people.

Our core product, the Backbase Digital-First Banking Platform, gives financials the speed and flexibility to create and manage seamless customer experiences across any device. We’re proud to have been recognized by big business analysts like Gartner, Forrester, and Ovum for our deep focus on customer experience and unmatched speed of implementation.

Change is at the core of everything we do, which means you will never get bored or too comfortable around here. People work at Backbase because of the challenges we face every day and the people we face these challenges with.
