### A Sprint Review is an essential part of the Sprint process. It’s an opportunity for the development team to show off its work and to excite stakeholders.


#### Agenda template
- Present the sprint goal
- Review of what’s done and what hasn’t been done
- Demo the work
- Ask questions and share observations
- Review the key metrics
- Review the timeline and priorities

### ***Preparation before the meeting***

## Ask yourself sprint oriented questions
 1. What is the goal of the sprint? How do I emphasise it during my presentation?
 2. Are all attendees on the same level of technical knowledge? How can we make sure that everybody understands everything?
 3. What critical information about business success has been previously previously discussed? How to refer to it during the demo?

## Organize an internal demo.
 1. The internal demo should reflect the actual meeting as faithfully as possible
 2. Present all features on testing environment
 3. Give feedback and implement potential improvements.

## Create a backup plan
 1. What are you going to do if a technical problem occurs?
 2. Who will be in charge if the person responsible for conducting the demo is disconnected?
 3. Which next steps should be given to stakeholders in the case of unpredictable errors?

### **Best Practises to follow for Sprint Review/Demo**
1. **Focus on acceptance criteria** You’ve defined what done means for the story (right?), so focus your demo around proving that you’re actually done.
2. **Start with the demo in mind**  Don’t wait to think about the demo until you’re done with the story. You might be able to write tests that double as demo scripts. And it’s best to plan your demo for a story while it’s fresh in your mind, before you move to the next story.
3. **Prepare**                      Don’t ad lib. Think through an interesting scenario to prove that you’ve satisfied the core acceptance criteria. Create any necessary test data. Use tools like Watir if necessary to get your app into a state where you can start an interesting demo.
4. **Practice**                     Run through the demo at least once. When you’re getting started, you might want to grab a trial version of Camtasia and record yourself giving the practice demo. Painful, huh? That just means you need to work on it.
5. **Tell a story**                 Center your demo around a realistic user solving a real problem. The point is not just to show that the software works, but to show that it’s valuable.
6. **Keep it short**                If you work on your stories one at a time and get them accepted when they’re ready, you don’t need to exhaustively cover all your acceptance criteria in your demo. Instead, focus your demo on what’s interesting and what’s valuable about each feature.

The sprint demo should be the most exciting part of Scrum. It’s when the team gets to show everyone all the value they’re delivering. That’s worth investing a little time to do well. You may find that previously disinterested stakeholders start coming just for the show.
