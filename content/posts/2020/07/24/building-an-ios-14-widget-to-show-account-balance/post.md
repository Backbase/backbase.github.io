[WWDC20](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/) has introduced us to [iOS 14](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-14-preview/), which along other features now include widgets on the home screen. Widgets arenâ€™t new, but now they are totally different - including the way you build them, support up to 3 different sizes and **are on the home screen!** ðŸ˜±

## **Why is this a big deal for us?**

Right there on your home screen you have meaningful information from your apps without even opening them. Itâ€™s meant to save you time and extend your experience. Itâ€™s an extension of your application.

## **Things to consider**

* Widgets are powered by SwiftUI, building one with UIKit is out of equation;
* They are extensions of your application, building a standalone widget is not possible;
* You can't interact with a widget other than tapping on it to launch your application - provide read-only information.

## **What we will build**

We'll assume my banking app has an open API which provides my list of accounts - in banking terms, products - in the following format. Where `type` is an enumeration of values `"main"` and `"secondary"`.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/arthurpalves/873f10882d710e62d14562ef24963940.js"></script>

Considering we can only have one main account, our widget will show the following details of this account:

```
	Name
	CurrencySign Balance

	When it was last updated
	SF Symbol (why not?! ðŸ™‚)
```

### **Our banking app**

As a widget can't exist standalone, I've previously built a SwiftUI application to list my accounts - not just the main one. It doesn't do much other than allowing me to show an accounts upon tapping on it and hidding it by tapping again.

### Setup

We now start by creating a new target of Widget Extension.
![Widget Target](assets/04_ios_widget_new_target.png)

During this process, I've named my Widget `CurrentAccount` and disabled `Include Configuration Intent` - as I don't want users to configure/edit the widget but read information from the main account only.

This process will create my target and add the following folder for my project

![Widget Folder](assets/04_ios_widget_folder.png)

### Now comes the fun part

In `CurrentAccount.swift` we already have everything we need, a `TimelineProvider`, a `TimelineEntry`, a `PlaceholderView`, a `EntryView` and our `Widget`.

Let's first go through every component in order to understand what they do and why we need them.

#### TimelineEntry

<script src="https://gist.github.com/arthurpalves/db94223877075ee8fa79fa90bffa3161.js"></script>

A widget receives information in time. This information is passed via a timeline entry, which by default needs a date where WidgetKit will render the widget.

Our Widget needs more than that. We'll create another type of entry which contains our main account (product)

<script src="https://gist.github.com/arthurpalves/db994081b8ca84d0aa91590b3038529f.js"></script>

Where `Product` is a simple struct shared from our main target

<script src="https://gist.github.com/arthurpalves/29dcb64ef89512baf6d578134db95174.js"></script>

#### TimelineProvider

Now that we have an entry, we need a way to provide this to the widget through time. The timeline provider is responsible for this.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/arthurpalves/1993f908023a6d50a297efc01eed0cb0.js"></script>

Here you notice it contains two methods, `snapshot` and `timeline`. The first is used to configure/render the widget in transient circumstances, think of it as a demonstration with mock data. We'll therefore implement it like so:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/arthurpalves/5e9f912d224cee638eea974c303c0a89.js"></script>

`timeline` is the method used for the real implementation. It will return on completion an array of your entries to be rendered at a given time. WidgetKit will be able to request multiple timelines, so it's not necessary to return multiple values in this array if your content is dynamically fetched.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/arthurpalves/3d4054897532f7148748c802cd41cbe4.js"></script>

One important thing in the code above is the `policy` expected when initializing a `Timeline`. From the documentation we see: `The policy that determines the earliest date and time WidgetKit requests a new timeline from a timeline provider`. It's a reload policy which can be:

* `atEnd` - Specifies that WidgetKit requests a new timeline after the last date in a timeline passes
* `never` - Specifies that WidgetKit should never request a new timeline. As an option, the application can still prompt WidgetKit when new timelines are available
* `after(_ date: Date)` - Pre defines a future date (from the last date in a timeline) that WidgetKit shall request a new one.

Knowing this and the fact that we retrieve a list of accounts for the given moment, our timeline will only return one entry. We'll make use of policy `after(_ date: Date)` to specify how many minutes after rendering we shall request a new timeline, therefore making a new request to fetch our data.

We'll use the current date for the current entry and a future date - 10 minutes apart - where the next timeline will be requested

<script src="https://gist.github.com/arthurpalves/c4d57a1284b28ee47d012174b06c5b80.js"></script>

We'll have to fetch new data in order to create our entry, since a `Product` is required. Having our entry, we can create a timeline and complete our implementation

<script src="https://gist.github.com/arthurpalves/6c244640c2e9def6e6060f76bb235eb0.js"></script>

Our entire `timeline` method looks like:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/arthurpalves/022e2b1d9e18c568cf3b681afc53ae00.js"></script>

Our widget will receive a new timeline - containing 1 entry - every 10 minutes.

#### Widget

The widget is very straight forward. We'll have to configure minor details, such as display name and description.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/arthurpalves/8c1682877a19d4364ee9c0917de03266.js"></script>

Note that this Widget uses a `StaticConfiguration`, as we don't want to allow users to configure/edit it. For a configurable widget, there is `IntentConfiguration`.

#### Views

As you might have seen, we have a `PlaceholderView()` and a `MainAccountEntryView`, that this widget uses. Both are pure SwiftUI views already provided during setup.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/arthurpalves/ef092f999ef088f5745bfc379f29d6fe.js"></script>

`PlaceholderView` - if the name isn't clear enough - is used when there is no timeline/entry to render. You can use it to display a generic message.

`MainAccountEntryView` is used to render your entries, here you want to display the information needed. It contains an `entry` property which, based on our Provider, contain a `Product`. We could therefore use product's information. Example:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/arthurpalves/198d8879002d1c5e677d290766a3fd15.js"></script>

#### Previews

As for any other SwiftUI view, we can also preview them in Xcode Canvas. We create a `PreviewProvider` to show multiple previews with a `Group`, one for our placeholder and another for our entry view.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/arthurpalves/92b90dc8d77e1e6c28b68c58fac8a448.js"></script>

You can potentially preview multiple `MainAccountEntryView` using different preview contexts, for instance, for the different widget sizes, `.systemSmall`, `.systemMedium` and `.systemLarge`.

#### Entry View

You have the freedom - and restrictions ðŸ˜… - of SwiftUI to build your placeholder and entry views. Therefore, the focus here isn't to go in depth there, but this is what I've used for the entry view:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/arthurpalves/8e68e9af101b2737516a87655e747fed.js"></script>

The color sets `widgetBackgroundColor` and `widgetBackgroundColor` have been added to the Assets and support dark mode ðŸŒ™

#### Supporting Different Sizes

Our widget is now ready in all 3 available sizes. What if you want to change that?
It's fairly easy with `supportedFamilies`. Let's add that to our widget:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/arthurpalves/063658004a8d04e5a7acfc8124fa2d1f.js"></script>

## Conclusion

Widgets in the home screen is a powerful feature of iOS 14. We've seen how easy it is to create one and improve the user experience of our users. An addition to a static widget is to make it configurable - say, if I'd allow the users to select which account they want to see instead of always the main account, this is possible with the power of intents and an `IntentConfiguration`, which I'll try to cover later.
