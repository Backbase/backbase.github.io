## Speakers & Topics

### Ernest Szczekocki

"The Emulator as an Environment for AI Agents in Mobile Development"

The Android Emulator is evolving into a powerful execution environment for AI agents in modern mobile development. This session explores how emulator-driven agents can observe runtime behavior, interact with applications, and enable new levels of automation, testing, and intelligent developer tooling.

#### BIO - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eszczekocki/)

Senior Android Developer bridging the Android ecosystem with AI and LLMs. I build agent-based systems and RAG solutions that optimize developers’ day-to-day work

### Mariusz Jakowienko

"Integrating the LLM Agent with Cucumber Studio via the MCP server to support test writing automation and test coverage"

As a principal iOS Developer specializing in AI-driven tooling for modern iOS development I design and build solutions that use LLM agents to meaningfully support unit and UI testing, focusing on reducing manual effort while improving quality and reliability. By integrating LLM agents with Cucumber Studio through an MCP server, I enable automated test writing, smarter test scenarios, and increased test coverage. My work bridges mobile engineering and applied AI to make testing more scalable, maintainable, and developer-friendly.
