"Easy debugging in Playwright"

Considering Software Quality in general there looms up the scary principle that the absence-of-errors in a software
product is a fallacy. It just so happens that Playwright library provides some interesting utilities for error hunting
in automated tests written in Playwright. Familiarising ourselves with these debugging tools can make finding bugs
easier and faster. This talk is to discuss and present some of them.
