# Speakers & Topics

"How to build your reputation, influence and impact as a real-world UX designer"

Figma is 70% of your job.  The other 70% (yes, your job requires 140%) is about making sure design actually has an impact and makes your product better for customers. In this talk, I cover  seven* practical principles you can follow to help make design (and yourself) indispensable in your organisation.
* May not actually be seven.

BIO
I’ve done a lot of things in the world of design, including working on the BBC’s first ever website, starting and selling the same UX consultancy twice, working in Africa for ages, becoming a Design Thinking facilitator for Deloitte consulting, leading design for a major bank, and being a product manager.  He has tried to remember what he has learned along the way, so that he can share it with you.

"Good enough research – how to gather data without direct access to users"

In the world of B2B2B products, conducting user research can be uniquely challenging due to limited direct access to end-users. Join us to hear about our way to navigate these constraints by employing unconventional methods to gather insights.

BIO
As a Senior UX Designer I am specializing in employee solutions at Backbase. My journey began in Graphic Design, where I contributed to diverse projects ranging from city wayfinding systems to packaging design. After several years in graphic design, I shifted my focus to user experience in the digital realm, primarily working on PaaS and SaaS solutions. I am deeply involved in every stage of the design process, from defining value and conducting research to crafting business requirements and delivering high-fidelity design.
