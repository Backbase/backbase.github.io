**Topic:** "Memory management for Data Structures - Fundamentals"

Data structures are the pillars of programming in any language. Working with them with a good understanding of how they interact with memory and how they perform in time is crucial for every software engineer.
On a daily basis developers need to solve problems first conceptually but later on if they want to tackle them properly only coding foundation is not enough.
The talk is going to first cover different data types that apply to any programming language and then focus on memory usage in context of performance.
