#### BIO
Namaste! I'm a Software Professional and Solutions Architect with over 14 years of experience. I specialize in building solutions with event-driven microservices, intelligent process automation, and cloud-native applications. With Backbase's focus on digital banking, I'm eager to share my expertise in technologies like Java, Kafka, AWS, OpenShift, Kubernetes, and Banking Domain knowledge, and of course, learn from your experiences at Backbase. And, by the way, when I'm not coding, you'll find me on the badminton court ‚Äì smashing those shuttles! It's my happy place. Currently, I'm spearheading projects with the largest private bank in the Philippines. Ping me if you're keen to know about Philippine payment systems and regulators, such as Instapay, PESONet, and the BSP, respectively. And, if you are up for a friendly Badminton match, even better!
