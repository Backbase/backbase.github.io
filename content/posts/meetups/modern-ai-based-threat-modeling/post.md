## Speakers & Topics

### [Krishna Kumar Sekar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krishna-kumar-sekar-9a090048/)
"Secure by design is a key principle in SDLC but maintaining the same design in throughout SDLC is not really happening in Agile world due to regular change/addition of requirement in mid of the SDLC. To eradicate and to overcome the security loopholes throughout SDLC a best and effective way in AI world is to automate threat modeling. Whenever a DFD changed threat modeling will happen automatically"
